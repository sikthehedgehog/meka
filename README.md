# Meka Grappler X

## How to play

* **D-pad:** move and aim
* **A/B/C:** shoot hook
* **Start:** pause game

## Building the game

You'll need the following tools and put them inside a `tools` subdirectory,
then you can just run `build.sh` (assuming you're on Linux, change the
script accordingly otherwise):

* asm68k
* mdtiler
* slz
* uftc
* tfi2eif
* pcm2ewf
* mml2esf

All of them except asm68k can be obtained from the [mdtools
repository](https://github.com/sikthehedgehog/mdtools/). You're also going
to need [Echo](https://github.com/sikthehedgehog/echo), but I've already
included a prebuilt binary.
